# Open Street Map Project
This project was carried out during the course of a Udacity (www.udacity.com) program called Data Analyst Nanodegree.

During the project, an open street map (www.openstreetmap.org) dataset as chosen by the student was audited and cleaned and subsequently imported in an SQL data base.
Using the data base, a number of insights regarding the city under consideration where gained using the open street map data.

All code was written in python or sql as appropriate. Plain python was used for the [cleaning](clean.py), [auditing](audit.py) and [exporting to .csv](osm2csv.py)
of the data. An [sqlite3 data base](osm_project.db) having a [schema](schema.sql) as provided by Udacity was created, using the command line. In a last step, the "data story" was told using
using a [Jupyter Notebook](osm_project.ipynb).
